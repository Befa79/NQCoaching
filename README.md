Nowadays, there is a huge demand in having a mentor with psychological, spiritial support or whatever method,

## Testing

For this project i made a lot of testing to make sure the calculations can't fail.
the most of the testing is for the javascript part, as each new line implementation required testing, i created 2 testing buttons to make sure the triggers worked. There is no doubt that each button click or label changes is triggering a function that calculate the needed information.

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

1. button:
    1. create a test button with test textanswer 
    2. apply different functions 
    3. finally kept the most efficient function
    4. applied the chosen function to the actual project


I get some bug, like the addeventtrigger that works better when placed in the hmtl file.
